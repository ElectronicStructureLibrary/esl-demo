  ! MPI relies on standard integer sizes
  ! However, if one wishes to build this application
  ! with default long integers, we have to be careful.
  integer, parameter :: im_ = selected_int_kind(9)

  ! Data-type for the contained elements
  integer, parameter :: ii_ = selected_int_kind(9)

  ! There are problems with having abstract interfaces and
  ! methods callable from sub-classed types.
  ! Hence we must simply force the implementor of new distributions
  ! to implement:
  !
  !   glob_2_loc
  !   loc_2_glob
  !   glob_2_rank
  !   local_N
  type :: mpi_dist_t

     !< Associated communicator with this distribution.
     integer(im_) :: comm = -1

     ! Note that rank and size are kept in the same precision
     ! as global_N because it allows "faster" arithmetic due to
     ! less casting. Or at least ideally...
     
     !< The MPI rank (MPI_Comm_rank(rank)) (i.e. 0-based)
     integer(ii_) :: rank = 0
     
     !< The MPI communicator size (MPI_Comm_size(size))
     integer(ii_) :: size = 1

     !< Total number of elements to distribute
     integer(ii_) :: global_N = 0

     ! Sadly creating public procedures (or generic procedures)
     ! forces the interfaces to be *exactly* the same.
     ! Perhaps I am missing something?
     ! I.e. sub-classed types should call %mpi_dist_t%init_(..)
     ! for correct interaction.
     ! This may propagate further by introducing problems when
     ! inheriting sub-classed distributions where the interface
     ! may be required to change.
